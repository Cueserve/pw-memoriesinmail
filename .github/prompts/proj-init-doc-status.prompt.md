# Project Init Document Status

Run the shared Project Initiation document status workflow.

Load `docs/guides/proj-init/doc-status.md`, then execute it exactly.

If the file fails to load, halt execution and output: `Error: docs/guides/proj-init/doc-status.md could not be loaded. Resolve this before continuing.`

Do not duplicate or override the shared workflow. `doc-status.md` owns the status workflow, implementation, and rules.
