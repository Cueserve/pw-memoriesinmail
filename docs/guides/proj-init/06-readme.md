# Step 6: README

**Output file:** `README.md`
**Depends on:** `PRODUCT.md` (Step 1), `PRD.md` (Step 2), `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Step 3), `TECH-STACK.md` (Step 4), `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` (Step 5)
**Required before:** sharing the repository with anyone or starting active development

---

## Goal

Create `README.md` as the entry point for any developer — human or AI — picking up this project for the first time.

## Objective

This document gives a complete, accurate picture of the project: what it is, how to get it running, and how to work on it. It is written last because it summarizes everything locked in Steps 1–5. It must stay current — a stale README is worse than none.

## What This Document Covers

- **Project overview** — what the product does and why it exists (derived from `PRODUCT.md`)
- **Key concepts** — 3–5 terms or ideas a new developer must understand before reading the code (domain terms from `PRODUCT.md`; structural concepts from `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- **Prerequisites** — exact tools, runtimes, and accounts required before setup (with version numbers)
- **Environment setup** — step-by-step instructions to configure `.env`; document every key in `.env.example` with a description, whether it is required or optional, and where to obtain the value (service dashboard, team wiki, etc.)
- **Install and run** — exact commands to install dependencies and start the app locally
- **Run tests** — exact commands to run the test suite
- **Project structure** — top-level folder map with one-line purpose per folder
- **Further reading** — `PRD.md` for requirements and feature scope; `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TECH-STACK.md`, and `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md` for deeper context on decisions

## Why This Matters

- Reduces onboarding friction — no tribal knowledge required to get started
- AI tools use README as primary context when CLAUDE.md or AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md are not present
- Serves as a project health signal — if README is hard to write, the setup is too complex

## Rules

- This step **replaces the boilerplate README** with the project's own. The boilerplate README's "Start Here" callout and scaffold content are removed here. By Step 6, the initiation process is complete, so the boilerplate entry point is no longer needed. The Project Initiation guides in `docs/guides/proj-init/` remain as the durable reference.
- Write README last. It documents what exists, not what you plan to build.
- Every command in README must be tested and working before it is committed.
- `.env.example` must list every environment variable the app reads — no undocumented keys.
- Do not duplicate content from `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `TECH-STACK.md` — link to them instead.
- If setup steps change, update README in the same commit.
- If any upstream document changes (`PRODUCT.md`, `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TECH-STACK.md`, `AI-TOOL-GUIDE.md`), reconcile README accordingly.
- README must be AI-readable: use clear section headings, avoid ambiguous prose, and include enough context for an AI agent to parse project state without reading any other file first.
